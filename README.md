## About The Project

This project is all about diving into the world of C programming! We're creating essential functions that act as building blocks for School 42 assignments. These functions mimic standard C functions, giving us a solid foundation. As we move forward, the skills learned here will help us confidently tackle more challenges.

## Getting Started

Here I will explain how to clone the repository and how to use it.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

### Usage

Firstly, you change the directory into the libft file you closed. Then you run make: 
```sh
cd libft
make
```
Running this command will compile the libft library, generating a libft.a file. Subsequently, you can link this library to your C project files during compilation using either gcc or cc.

## Functions and what they do
